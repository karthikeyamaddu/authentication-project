# Authentication Project

This is an educational platform authentication project built using **React**, **Python (Flask)**, and **MongoDB**. It integrates **Google Authenticator** for two-factor authentication (2FA), where users can generate and verify OTPs for enhanced security.

## Features

- **User Registration & Login**: Users can sign up and log in securely.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Users can scan a QR code generated by the system using Google Authenticator, which provides a time-based OTP for additional security.
- **MongoDB Integration**: User information, including their authentication keys, is stored securely in MongoDB for persistence.
- **Dynamic QR Code Generation**: Based on user input, the system generates a QR code for 2FA setup, which can be scanned using Google Authenticator.
- **OTP Verification**: After scanning the QR code, users enter the OTP they receive in Google Authenticator to authenticate and gain access.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: MongoDB (Compass)
- **Authentication**: Google Authenticator (TOTP)
- **Package Management**: npm, Python Virtual Environment
- **QR Code Generation**: `pyotp`, `qrcode`

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/authentication-project.git
cd authentication-project


Set Up the Backend
Install Python Dependencies:
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy
Edit
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy
Edit
source venv/bin/activate
Install required Python packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask app:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
The backend will be running at http://127.0.0.1:5000.


Set Up the Frontend
Navigate to the frontend folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd client
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Start the React development server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173


MongoDB Setup
Install MongoDB Compass if you haven't already.
Create a database in MongoDB Compass, and configure your connection URI in the Flask app (app.py).
Ensure MongoDB is running on your system.


Usage
Open the web app in your browser: http://localhost:5173.
You can register a new user by entering a name, roll number, and generating a QR code for 2FA setup.
After registering, the QR code is generated and can be scanned using the Google Authenticator app.
Enter the OTP generated by Google Authenticator to authenticate and log in.
